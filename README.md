**Link to Website**  
https://mateonav53.github.io/GIFZone/

**Project Overview**  
- This page was created by Mateo Navarrette. It is dedicated to searching for GIFs via giphy.com's GIF database.
   
**Details on Functionality**  
- Users are able to search for 30 GIFs on the site's homepage via the search input field in the middle. The site makes an ajax call to Giphy's API and displays the results on screen. There is also a short "About" page where users can read about the site 
  
**Technologies Used**  
- The site's content is on two HTML pages, which are being styled by a CSS sheet. That CSS sheet is linked to a Sass sheet via the extension Live Sass Compiler so all changes via SCSS get updated automatically. Javascript and JQuery were used to make an ajax request to Giphy's API and return search results, then display them on screen. 
  
**Ideas for Future Improvement**  
1. Add a button to download or generate a link for the GIFs, so that people can share their favorites  .

2. Add a button next to the search button, "Number of GIFs" that displays the selected amount of GIFs, ex. 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.  

3.  Create a new page with links/instructions teaching people how to make their own GIFs.

**User Stores**  
1. As a person with age ranging from childhood to middle age, I want to find gifs so I can share them with my friends and social media followers.  
Â 
2. As an older person, I want to use and discover gifs so I can relate to the younger people around me.  

3. As a Twitter user, I want to be able to search and download gifs so I can have them ready to tweet in reaction to current events
